            <p>The legal terms You need to know about Your pay monthly mobile communications service. Version 03 for
                customers joining or upgrading from 11 November 2015.</p>
            <p>Here�s a brief summary of some key points which We�d like to draw to Your attention. They�re a useful
                guide to the Agreement but aren�t part of it. You should still refer to the terms and conditions
                below.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>1. Our Network</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>You can use Our Network to make and receive calls (including internet phone calls known as VoIP) and
                texts and use the internet over 2G and 3G. If You have 4G compatible Equipment and a compatible Price
                Plan, You can also use Our 4G Network. We will try to provide a high-quality Network to You at all
                times. However, We cannot guarantee that We will always be able to provide Network coverage. You need to
                check the coverage You might get before buying the Services on Our coverage checker, which can be found
                on Our website (ee.co.uk/coverage). The availability and quality of the Services are affected by a
                number of things such as the number of people using the Network and Your location (see points 4.1, 4.2
                and 4.3 of the terms and conditions).</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>2. Equipment</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>You may get Equipment from Us for free or for an upfront cost when You take out a Price Plan, or You may
                be able to take out a Finance agreement to purchase Equipment from Us. Unless We tell You otherwise We
                will own any Equipment provided to You by Us for the first six months of the Minimum Term (see point
                10.1). If You take out a Price Plan via a third party who is not EE and get Equipment from that third
                party when You take out the Price Plan, that third party may own any Equipment provided to You by them
                for the first six months of the Minimum Term (see point 10.2). During this time You will be required to
                take all reasonable care with the Equipment and keep it in good condition as if You owned it (see point
                10.3.2). During that 6 month time period You must not give or sell the Equipment to anyone else without
                our prior written consent (see point 10.3.1). We will collect network data and Equipment details (using
                software installed on the Equipment) in order to Disable the Equipment in certain instances of fraud or
                non-payment occurring in the first 6 months (see points 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3). If You get Equipment from
                Us under a Finance agreement, You will own the Equipment from the moment of purchase (see point 10.1).
                You will have to enter into a separate Finance agreement and other terms will also apply to You.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>3. Unlocking</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Any Equipment that We provide to You will be locked to Our Network. It may not be possible to unlock it.
                If it can be unlocked We may charge You (see point 10.5 of the terms and conditions).</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>4. Minimum Term</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>You will have to agree to stay with Us for a minimum period of time which We call the Minimum Term. This
                Minimum Term will be agreed with You and You will have to pay a regular monthly charge for this which We
                call the Monthly Charge. You can find details of Your Monthly Charge, Charges for Additional Services
                and all other Charges in Our Plan Price Guide and Non-Standard Price Guide which can be found on Our
                website.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>5. Upgrades and Renewals</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>We want Our customers to stay with Us, but We don�t have to provide You with an Upgrade or Renewal. If
                You accept an Upgrade or Renewal then a new Minimum Term will be agreed with You and You will have to
                pay the Monthly Charge for the rest of the new Minimum Term (see points 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 of the terms
                and conditions).</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>6. Annual Price Increase</b></p>
            <p>Your Price Plan Charge includes an increase by the annual percentage increase in the Retail Price Index
                (RPI). We will do this so the price increase takes effect in March of each year (see point 7 of the
                terms and conditions).</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>7. Changing the Terms and Charges</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>We may change the terms and conditions or the Services. If We do make these changes, We�ll give You
                Written Notice when We can before the change takes effect (see points 7 and 12.1 of the terms and
                conditions). We may also increase or decrease Our prices. You agree that We can change these Terms and
                Charges without obtaining Your express consent to vary the Agreement providing We comply with the
                procedure in point 12. Some of the price increases may give You the right to leave the Agreement without
                paying a Cancellation Charge (see point 8.4 of the terms and conditions).</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>8. Ending this Agreement</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>You can phone Us and give 30 days� notice to end this Agreement. Unless We tell You otherwise You will
                have to pay a charge for ending the Agreement before the end of the Minimum Term which We call the
                Cancellation Charge. The Cancellation Charge is the total of the Monthly Charges for the remainder of
                the Minimum Term, less any discount You are entitled to. If You end this Agreement after the end of the
                Minimum Term You will have to pay Charges during the 30 days� notice period (see points 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3
                of the terms and conditions).</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>9. Breaking this Agreement</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>There are instances in which, because of something You do or do not do, We can suspend or disconnect You
                from the Services and/or end this Agreement. You may have to pay Us a Cancellation Charge as a result
                (see point 6.3 of the terms and conditions).</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>10. Billing</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>We will make a bill available to You each month. This may be by post or electronically, at Our choosing.
                You will need to pay it by the date set out on it to ensure continued access to the Service. It is Your
                responsibility to contact Us if You are unable to access a bill sent electronically (see points 5.5.3
                and 6.2.2 of the terms and conditions).</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>11. Lost or Stolen Equipment</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>You must call customer services as soon as You realise that the Equipment and/or a SIM Card has been lost
                or stolen, become infected by a Virus or used by an unauthorised third party. You will have to pay for
                any Charges incurred on Your Account before You told Us (see points 5.14, 13.8 and 13.9 of the terms and
                conditions).</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>12. Credit Limits</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>We can set and change credit limits for Charges. If You go over Your credit limit, Your Service may be
                suspended (see points 5.4 and 6.1.2 of the terms and conditions).</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>13. Our liability to You</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>There are certain circumstances in which Our liability to You is limited or excluded (see point 13 of the
                terms and conditions).</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>14. Your Information</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>You (and anyone who You buy the Equipment for) agree that We, Our Group Companies and Our service
                providers, can use information about You including information about Your use of Our Network, Services
                and related products and the location of the Equipment that You are using on Our Network to tell You
                about Our products and services and third party products and services that may be of interest to You.
                You can ask Us to stop sending You direct marketing at any time (see point 15.4 of the terms and
                conditions). Please refer to Our privacy policy on Our website for full details on how We process your
                personal information.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>15. These key points</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Remember that We�ve set out some of the key points of the Agreement between You and Us. They aren�t a
                substitute for what the main Agreement says, and if there�s a clash between what the main Agreement and
                what these key points say, then what the Agreement says is right.</p>
            <p></p>
